## üöÄ Overview

**Easy CSV Editor** is a macOS application built to simplify the process of managing, editing, analyzing, and visualizing CSV and other tabular data formats. For users who frequently work with spreadsheets, data exports, or logs, this tool provides a rich set of features that go beyond the basics.  

Imagine you have hundreds or thousands of rows from exported reports, server logs, user data, or financial statements. With Easy CSV Editor, you can open these large files without the sluggishness found in many generic spreadsheet programs. You can filter, sort, search with complex criteria, and make batch edits (replace, delete, insert) with minimal effort. The editor supports undo/redo, and changes save to CSV or other delimited formats without damaging data integrity.  

A standout feature is its ability to handle large datasets with a smooth, responsive interface. Even when dealing with tens of thousands of rows, it remains usable. The app supports custom delimiters (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe, etc.), encoding detection, and flexible quoting options. It also includes features like view toggling (raw CSV vs. formatted table), column reordering, hiding/unhiding columns, and quick data sorting.  

Beyond basic editing, Easy CSV Editor includes visualization tools ‚Äî basic chart previews or summary statistics for selected columns, such as minimum, maximum, average, counts, and duplicates detection. These are especially useful for analysts, data scientists, accountants, or business users who want insights without exporting to another tool.

Overall, this app is designed for anyone who needs full control over CSV files: software testers, data analysts, developers, small business owners, or power users who want something more capable but still lightweight and native on macOS.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

Easy CSV Editor was created to address the frustration users often face when working with tabular data in cumbersome spreadsheet apps or fragile tools. CSVs are ubiquitous ‚Äî logs, exports, backups, data transfers ‚Äî yet editing them safely and efficiently is often harder than it should be. This app aims to bridge that gap with a stable, powerful, yet accessible editor.  

It supports macOS-native features: drag-and-drop to open files, file watchers to reload if the file changes, autosave, and dark mode. The developer has built in strong CSV parsing robustness: different dialects, handling of quoting issues, malformed rows, and large file performance.  

Security and fidelity are important: the app doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúguess‚Äù formats in ways that corrupt data. You control how things are parsed and saved. Encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.) are respected, and you can specify behavior for edge cases.  

Another important aspect is flexibility: while it is simple for straightforward editing, its advanced features make it suitable for more complex tasks: batch processing, filtering by multiple conditions, exporting subsets, mapping or transforming columns, and integrating with external workflows (scripts, command-line export).  

For users who need both power and simplicity, Easy CSV Editor offers a balance: you get many of the features typically found in more heavyweight data tools, but packaged in a lean, responsive macOS app that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm.
